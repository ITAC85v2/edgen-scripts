This is a new version of the anti-anti-duplicate tabs I made which is compatible with EdgenTweaks.
**WARNING: THIS MAY BREAK SOME ASSIGNMENTS! I have not *yet* experienced any issues using this, but it doesn't mean none will show up.**

1. Get [uBlock Origin from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
2. Go to **chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/dashboard.html#1p-filters.html**
3. Add the following filter to the list: `core.learn.edgenuity.com##+js(aeld, storage)`
4. If you used the [old version](https://github.com/ITAC85v2/edgen-scripts/blob/main/tutorials/duplicate-tabs-old.md), please remove the old lines from the filter list, otherwise you'll still encounter issues.
5. Hit **"Apply Changes"**.
